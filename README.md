# web base
<hr/>

when learning laravel first time, i was wondering how do developpers build
that awesome framework, after reading the documentation of laravel
i feel like wow ! how could them make the programming easy like that
so, i toke the decision to try to build a simple framework,
i build simple framework that implement some main concepts and components
and techniques like binding, and routing...etc

to start try it just install it from github and download dependencies using composer
by executing these commands : 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/karimaouaouda/web-base.git --depth=1 # download the project with last changes

cd web-base #navigate to the project folder

composer install #install dependencies 

php -S localhost:3000 -t public 
```
